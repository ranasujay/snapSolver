  const prompt = `You have been given an image with some mathematical expressions, equations, or graphical problems, and you need to solve them.
  Note: Use the PEMDAS rule for solving mathematical expressions. PEMDAS stands for the Priority Order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Parentheses have the highest priority, followed by Exponents, then Multiplication and Division, and lastly Addition and Subtraction.
  For example:
  Q. 2 + 3 * 4
  (3 * 4) => 12, 2 + 12 = 14.
  Q. 2 + 3 + 5 * 4 - 8 / 2
  5 * 4 => 20, 8 / 2 => 4, 2 + 3 => 5, 5 + 20 => 25, 25 - 4 => 21.
  YOU CAN HAVE FIVE TYPES OF EQUATIONS/EXPRESSIONS IN THIS IMAGE, AND ONLY ONE CASE SHALL APPLY EVERY TIME:
  Following are the cases:
  1. Simple mathematical expressions like 2 + 2, 3 * 4, 5 / 6, 7 - 8, etc.: In this case, solve and return the answer in the format of a LIST OF ONE DICT [{"expr": given expression, "result": calculated answer}].
  2. Set of Equations like x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, 3y + 4x = 0, 5x^2 + 6y + 7 = 12, etc.: In this case, solve for the given variable, and the format should be a COMMA SEPARATED LIST OF DICTS, with dict 1 as {"expr": "x", "result": 2, "assign": true} and dict 2 as {"expr": "y", "result": 5, "assign": true}. This example assumes x was calculated as 2, and y as 5. Include as many dicts as there are variables.
  3. Assigning values to variables like x = 4, y = 5, z = 6, etc.: In this case, assign values to variables and return another key in the dict called {"assign": true}, keeping the variable as 'expr' and the value as 'result' in the original dictionary. RETURN AS A LIST OF DICTS.
  4. Analyzing Graphical Math problems, which are word problems represented in drawing form, such as cars colliding, trigonometric problems, problems on the Pythagorean theorem, adding runs from a cricket wagon wheel, etc. These will have a drawing representing some scenario and accompanying information with the image. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO DIFFERENT COLORS FOR THESE PROBLEMS. You need to return the answer in the format of a LIST OF ONE DICT [{"expr": given expression, "result": calculated answer}].
  5. Detecting Abstract Concepts that a drawing might show, such as love, hate, jealousy, patriotism, or a historic reference to war, invention, discovery, quote, etc. USE THE SAME FORMAT AS OTHERS TO RETURN THE ANSWER, where 'expr' will be the explanation of the drawing, and 'result' will be the abstract concept.
  Analyze the equation or expression in this image and return the answer according to the given rules:
  Make sure to use extra backslashes for escape characters like \\f -> \\\\f, \\n -> \\\\n, etc.
  Here is a dictionary of user-assigned variables. If the given expression has any of these variables, use its actual value from this dictionary accordingly: ${JSON.stringify(dict_of_vars)}.
  DO NOT USE BACKTICKS OR MARKDOWN FORMATTING.
  PROPERLY QUOTE THE KEYS AND VALUES IN THE DICTIONARY FOR EASIER PARSING WITH JavaScript's JSON.parse.
  YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE TYPES OF EQUATIONS/EXPRESSIONS IN THIS IMAGE, AND YOU SHOULD HANDLE ALL CASES:

1. Simple mathematical expressions like 2 + 2, 3 * 4, 5 / 6, 7 - 8, etc.
2. Set of Equations like x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, 3y + 4x = 0, 5x^2 + 6y + 7 = 12, etc.
3. Assigning values to variables like x = 4, y = 5, z = 6, etc.
4. Analyzing Graphical Math problems, which are word problems represented in drawing form.
5. Detecting Abstract Concepts that a drawing might show.
6. Complex mathematical operations including:
a. Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.)
b. Logarithms and exponential functions
c. Calculus problems (derivatives, integrals, limits)
d. Matrix operations
e. Complex numbers
7. Multi-step word problems requiring logical reasoning and mathematical modeling.
8. Interpretation of complex graphs, charts, and data visualizations.
9. Unit conversions and dimensional analysis problems.
10. Probability and statistics problems, including distributions, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.
11. Financial calculations such as compound interest, present value, future value, and loan amortization.
12. Scientific notation and significant figures in calculations.
13. Geometry problems involving areas, volumes, and spatial reasoning.
14. Number theory problems, including prime numbers, factorization, and modular arithmetic.
15. Optimization problems using linear programming or other methods.


For ALL cases, including complex problems that may not seem to fit the original format, you MUST return the answer in the format of a LIST OF DICTS:

[{"expr": "description or summary of the problem", "result": "calculated answer or explanation"}]

For multi-step problems or problems requiring explanation:

1. Break down the problem into logical steps.
2. Use the "expr" field to describe each step or sub-problem.
3. Use the "result" field to provide the intermediate calculation or explanation for that step.
4. The final dict in the list should summarize the overall problem and provide the final answer.


Example for a complex word problem:
[
{"expr": "Calculate the volume of a cylinder", "result": "V = πr^2h"},
{"expr": "Given radius r = 5 cm and height h = 10 cm", "result": "Substituting values"},
{"expr": "V = π * (5 cm)^2 * 10 cm", "result": "Calculating"},
{"expr": "V = π * 25 cm^2 * 10 cm", "result": "Simplifying"},
{"expr": "V = 250π cm^3", "result": "Final answer: The volume is approximately 785.4 cm^3"}
]

For problems involving graphs or visual elements:

1. Describe the key features of the graph or visual in the "expr" field.
2. Provide interpretation or calculations based on the visual information in the "result" field.


Example for a graph interpretation:
[
{"expr": "Graph shows exponential growth of bacteria over time", "result": "Identifying trend"},
{"expr": "Initial population at t=0 is 100 bacteria", "result": "Reading y-intercept"},
{"expr": "Population doubles approximately every 2 hours", "result": "Calculating doubling time"},
{"expr": "After 6 hours, the population is about 800 bacteria", "result": "Reading graph at t=6"},
{"expr": "Exponential growth model: P(t) = 100 * 2^(t/2)", "result": "Final answer: Mathematical model for bacterial growth"}
]

Analyze the equation, expression, or problem in this image and return the answer according to the given rules:

Make sure to use extra backslashes for escape characters like \f -> \\f, \n -> \\n, etc.

Here is a dictionary of user-assigned variables. If the given expression has any of these variables, use its actual value from this dictionary accordingly: ${JSON.stringify(dict_of_vars)}.

DO NOT USE BACKTICKS OR MARKDOWN FORMATTING.
PROPERLY QUOTE THE KEYS AND VALUES IN THE DICTIONARY FOR EASIER PARSING WITH JavaScript's JSON.parse.

ALWAYS STRIVE TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AND ACCURATE ANSWER, EVEN FOR COMPLEX OR UNUSUAL PROBLEMS, WHILE ADHERING TO THE SPECIFIED OUTPUT FORMAT.
